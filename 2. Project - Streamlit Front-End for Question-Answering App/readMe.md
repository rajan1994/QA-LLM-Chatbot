# Streamlit Q&A Application

## Introduction

This code snippet is a Streamlit application that empowers users to perform Q&A (Question and Answer) tasks on uploaded documents. It leverages OpenAI to create embeddings, allowing users to ask questions about the content of the document and receive answers.

## Features

The main functions and features of this code snippet include:

- **load_document**: Loads a document from a file.
- **chunk_data**: Splits the document into manageable chunks.
- **create_embeddings**: Creates embeddings using the OpenAI API and stores them in a Chroma vector store.
- **ask_and_get_answer**: Allows users to ask questions and obtain answers based on the embeddings.
- **calculate_embedding_cost**: Calculates the cost of embeddings generation using the Tiktoken library.
- **clear_history**: Clears the chat history from the Streamlit session state.

## How to Use

To use this application effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
   - Set up an OpenAI API key and ensure it's available as an environment variable.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the Streamlit application using the following command:
     ```
     streamlit run chat_with_documents.py
     ```

3. **Upload a Document**:
   - Use the provided file upload widget to select a document for analysis.

4. **Choose Chunk Size**:
   - Select an appropriate chunk size to divide the document for processing.

5. **Ask Questions**:
   - Enter your questions in the input field.
   - Choose the number of answers to return (if applicable).

6. **Get Answers**:
   - The application will process the document, generate embeddings, and provide answers based on your questions.

7. **View Chat History**:
   - The chat history panel displays previous questions and answers.

8. **Clear History**:
   - Use the "Clear History" button to reset the chat history.

## Dependencies

This code snippet assumes the presence of certain dependencies and environment variables, including:
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages for document loading, text splitting, and embedding creation.

Ensure you have these dependencies set up and configured before running the application.

## Note

This application is designed to facilitate Q&A tasks on documents using OpenAI embeddings. It's important to handle sensitive documents and data with care, especially in terms of data privacy and security.
